# Alcohol Minimums
We have a few additional minimums we ask from event which server alcohol.
### For the parts of your event or peripheral events where alcohol is provided or expected to be consumed...
* There are good non-alcoholic options available
* There are safe transportation options available
* Steps are taken to insure everyone knows what said options are and how to access them
* People are encouraged to use said transportation options
* Steps are taken to insure everyone knows the Code of Conduct still applies during event activities that involve alcohol
