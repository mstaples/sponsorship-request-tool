This tool pulls info from SurveyMonkey survey submissions, 
* performs an initial analysis of that data using operator defined weights and 
* delivers a formatted report of that analysis as well as selected raw data to the targeted recipient via SendGrid
* in order to facilitate the evaluation of sponsorship requests based on diversity and inclusion standards.
